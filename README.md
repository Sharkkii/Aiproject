# Development Project for AI-powered System

This development project was created in a course (Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence) provided by UTokyo. We students work on research projects on AI-related topics or development projects on AI-powered systems. What I have worked on is **AI-powered progress management system (AI-PMS)**.

On AI-PMS, users can try out job-scheduling on their existing tasks. The AI-powered system gives them suggestions on what task they first deal with.

This AI-powered system is based on reinforcement learning (RL); it solves the job scheduling problem with the RL framework, not a rule-based approach. Specifically, it uses Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm implemented in [shaRL](https://github.com/Sharkkii/shaRL).

## Demo

Presentation slides used in the course can be seen at [Aiproject/demo](https://github.com/Sharkkii/Aiproject/tree/develop/demo).

## Manual

A small document about AI-PMS is available at [Aiproject/docs](https://github.com/Sharkkii/Aiproject/tree/develop/docs).
